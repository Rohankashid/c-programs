Limited to local participants: Traditional auctions, such as those held at auctions in Texas venues, require bidders to be physically present at the event, which may exclude potential geographically distant buyers.
Costs associated with holding the event: Organizing a live auction involves expenses such as venue rental, advertising, and hiring an auctioneer.
Time-consuming for buyers and sellers: Attending a traditional auction can be time-consuming, as bidders must allocate time to travel to the event, examine items, and participate in the bidding process.
